Requirements:

libxmljs (npm install libxmljs)
winston (npm install winston) - Might be removed in future versions.

This is still a work in progress, see the tests.js for example on usage.

Events emited:

'event': 	When an event occurs on the remote asterisk
'connected':	When the library connects
'disconnected':	When the library disconnects
'error':	When an error occurs

This has been tested and works properly on Asterisk 10.7.0
