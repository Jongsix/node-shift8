Requirements:

libxmljs (npm install libxmljs)
winston (npm install winston) - Might be removed in future versions.

This is still a work in progress, see the tests.js for example on usage. Basic functionality for now, allowing to login, logoff and waitevent() from the library.

All other actions must invoke send() directly. 

Events emited:

'event': 	When an event occurs on the remote asterisk
'connected':	When the library connects
'disconnected':	When the library disconnects
'error':	When an error occurs

Asterisk has a bug on it's manager interface that normally crashes the node.js parser (thanks stagas). I've attached an 1.8.x patch on the repository and added a ticket on the asterisk issue system.
